A focused collection of reverse engineering explorations, uncovering the inner workings of compiled software through careful analysis and binary deconstruction. This repository features deep dives into x86/x64 assembly, C/C++ disassembly, control flow reconstruction, and the defeat of software obfuscation, licensing checks, and packers.
